                                  A contemporary analysis of drug misuse deaths in England

In 2021, 2846 deaths in England occurred as a result of poisoning from drug misuse, an 80% rise on 2011 levels (ONS, 2022). Looking at this figure, it would be reasonable to assume that the prevalence of drug misuse itself must also be rising. 

Yet, in 2021, the proportion of individuals reporting drug use in the previous year remained steadily below 10%, and represents the continuation of a relatively stable trend since 2011 (ONS, 2022). So, if drug misuse prevalence is falling, yet deaths from drug misuse are rising, what is behind this disparity? 

This project assesses how, between 2000-2021, drug misuse deaths have changed across England, and whether there are differences in mortality between genders and age bands. It also assesses the association between drug misuse prevalence and drug misuse deaths. Next, the spatial variability in drug misuse deaths in 2021 is examined, finding trends and statistically significant spatial clustering. Associations between demographic factors (such as Income Deprivation Score and household tenure type) and drug misuse deaths at a local authority scale are identified, and spatial variation in such associations is presented. Finally, forecasts are made for future trends in drug misuse deaths in England.
